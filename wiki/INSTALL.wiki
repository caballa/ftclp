=Install And Usage=

This guide is only for Linux OS and it has only been tested with Ubuntu 12.04 on a 64-bit machine.

==Requirements==

  If your OS is linux 64 bits, then you need to install the 32-bit libraries:

  For Ubuntu:
       sudo apt-get install ia32-libs libc6-i386 libc6-dev-i386 lib32gcc1 
       lib32stdc++6 g++-4.6-multilib lib32bz2-dev  lib32z1-dev

  Also, you might need to add manually the symbolic link:
       ln -s /usr/lib32/libstdc++.so.6 /usr/lib32/libstdc++.so



==Setup==

The distribution comes as a compressed tarball named
ftclp.xx.yy.tar.gz, where xx.yy is a version number. Unpack the
distribution somewhere in your home directory and set the value of the
environment variable FTCLP_INSTALL to the absolute path of the
distribution. For example, if you've unpacked the distribution in the
directory /home/jorge/ftclp.xx.yy, then you shall add the
following commands to your profile:

{{{
export FTCLP_INSTALL=/home/jorge/ftclp.xx.yy
}}}

You might also want to update your PATH variable as follows:

{{{
export PATH=${PATH}:${FTCLP_INSTALL}/bin
}}}

{{{
make install
}}}

This will install any required third-party system.

{{{
make all
}}}

This will compile all the files and will generate the executable file
ftclp.xx.yy in the bin directory.

==Usage==

{{{
ftclp.xx.yy -help
}}}
